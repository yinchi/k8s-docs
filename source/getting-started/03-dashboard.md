The Kubernetes dashboard
========================

Minikube includes an easy command for acessing the dashboard. First, let us add the Metrics Server to the dashboard:

```bash
minikube addons enable metrics-server
```

You should see the following output:

```console
ðŸ’¡  metrics-server is an addon maintained by Kubernetes. For any concerns contact minikube on GitHub.
You can view the list of minikube maintainers at: https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/OWNERS
    â–ª Using image registry.k8s.io/metrics-server/metrics-server:v0.7.1
ðŸŒŸ  The 'metrics-server' addon is enabled
```

Next, launch the dashboard:
```bash
minikube dashboard
```

Initially, you will see "There is nothing to display here", as we have not added any pods/deployments/services to the default namespace.

```{note}
A namespace is a logical grouping of K8s entities. Many `kubectl` commands use a `-n` flag to select the namespace to act on.
```

Use the top menubar to select all namespaces, then select Services from the left sidebar. You will see `kubernetes-dashboard` as one of the services. Node that `kubernetes-dashboard` is also the name of a deployment, and a pod exists with name `kubernetes-dashboard-779776cb65-bzx7t` (or similar). The relationship between these will be explained in later sections.

Select `Deployments > kubernetes-dashboard` and scroll down to find the "New Replica Set" section. The name of the image used to provide the K8s dashboard service can be found here.

## Accessing the dashboard remotely

K8s exposes its services on port 8001 by default. Activate this as follows (replace the login details with your own):

:::{code-block} console
user@local$ ssh -L 12345:localhost:8001 user@remote
user@remote's password:

user@remote$ kubectl proxy
Starting to serve on 127.0.0.1:8001
:::

Then, on the local machine, go to <http://localhost:12345/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/http:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/> to open the K8s dashboard.

## Next steps

We will mostly use the command line to configure our K8s cluster; however, any changes will show in the dashboard.
